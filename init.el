Group 1 contains the character before the potential pangu

when both group 1 and group 2 are non-nil. Group 3 exists as a
workaround for excluded puncuation.

Since rx does not support matching text that satisfy two regexp
at the same time (we want to match all Chinese two byte
characters, but not the punctuation), we first try to match
excluded puncuation, then the characters that need
pangu-spacing. The excluded puncuation will be matched to group
3, and shortcut the matching for Chinese characters.  Thus group
1 and group 2 will both be non-nil when a pangu space is needed."
