* Why Emacs

Emacs changes how you think about programming.

Emacs is *totally introspectable*. You can always find out 'what code
runs when I press this button?'.

Emacs is an *incremental programming environment*. There's no
edit-compile-run cycle. There isn't even an edit-run cycle. You can
execute snippets of code and gradually turn them into a finished
project. There's no distinction between your editor and your
interpreter.

Emacs is a *mutable environment*. You can set variables, tweak
functions with advice, or redefine entire functions. Nothing is
off-limits.

Emacs provides *functionality without applications*. Rather than
separate applications, functionality is all integrated into your Emacs
instance. Amazingly, this works. Ever wanted to use the same snippet
tool for writing C++ classes as well as emails?

Emacs is full of *incredible software concepts that haven't hit the
mainstream yet*. For example:

- Many platforms have a single item clipboard. Emacs has an *infinite
  clipboard*.

- If you undo a change, and then continue editing, you can't redo the
  original change. Emacs allows *undoing to any historical state*,
  even allowing tree-based exploration of history.

- Emacs supports a *reverse variable search*: you can find variables
  with a given value.

- You can perform *structural editing* of code, allowing you to make
  changes without breaking syntax. This works for lisps (paredit) and
  non-lisps (smartparens).

- Many applications use a modal GUI: for example, you can't do other
  edits during a find-and-replace operation. Emacs provides *recursive
  editing* that allow you to suspend what you're currently doing,
  perform other edits, then continue the original task.

Emacs has a *documentation culture*. Emacs includes a usage manual, a
lisp programming manual, pervasive docstrings and even an interactive
tutorial.

Emacs has a *broad ecosystem*. If you want to edit code in a niche
language, there's probably an Emacs package for it.

Emacs doesn't have a monopoly on good ideas, and there are other great
tools out there. Nonetheless, we believe the [[file:etc/editor-learning-curve.jpg][Emacs learning curve pays
off]].
